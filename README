This is a very small CMS project. It's made by overriding Django's FlatPage app.
By doing this we can add extra fields at the FlatPage model. I have added three extra fields:
published, keywords and description. The first is a boolean so one can prepare a page and publish it when it's ready.
The other two are optional text fields for populating the relevant meta tags of a page.

I have also added a Menu model which groups relevant pages and displays the appropriate menu.
For example, by creating a menu with a url /products/ it will link and dislpay all pages that start with /products/.

Menus, like pages, can be viewed by all or by authenticated users.
When a menu has the "required authentication" field checked, it will only be visible by logged in users.
It will still display all the pages matching it's url regardless if the pages themselves require authentication.

pCMS has tinyMCE at the admin interface for designing the page.
It also includes elfinder for uploading images.
The template used for rendering pages is Bootstrap from Twitter.
